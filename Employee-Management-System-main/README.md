# Employee-Management-

Developed a web-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Employee Management System that enables efficient management of employee data including adding, updating, viewing, and deleting employee records. The application follows the MVC architecture using Spring Boot and interacts with a MySQL database through Spring Data JPA. Frontend is implemented using Thymeleaf templates.
