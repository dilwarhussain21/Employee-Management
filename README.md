# Employee Management System (Spring Boot, JPA, MySQL, Thymeleaf)

Developed a comprehensive **web-based Employee Management System** designed to streamline CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee data. The application follows **MVC architecture** with Spring Boot at the core, enabling efficient backend operations and seamless integration with a MySQL database via Spring Data JPA. The frontend is built using **Thymeleaf templates**, ensuring dynamic and user-friendly interfaces for managing employee records.

**Key Contributions & Features:**

* **Designed and developed a full-stack web application** for managing employee information, supporting functionalities like adding new employees, updating details, retrieving data, and deleting records.
* **Implemented CRUD operations** with RESTful endpoints, dynamic view rendering, and form handling using Thymeleaf for smooth user interactions.
* **Applied layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)** to ensure maintainable, testable, and modular code.
* **Integrated Spring Data JPA for ORM**, reducing boilerplate code and simplifying database queries with repository interfaces.
* **Enabled seamless record management** through the use of path variables, request parameters, and form data binding.
* **Ensured separation of concerns and scalability** by following **industry-standard design patterns** like DAO and Dependency Injection.
* **Configured MySQL database** with proper entity relationships, schema generation, and optimized persistence queries.
* **Enhanced user experience** by providing responsive and dynamic views with Thymeleaf templates.
* Followed **best coding practices, exception handling, and input validation** to ensure application reliability and security.
* Improved maintainability and collaboration by using **Git for version control** and documenting the project structure for clarity.
